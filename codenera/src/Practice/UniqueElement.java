/*3.Write a Java program to rearrange a given array of unique elements such that every
 *  second element of the array is greater than its left and right elements.  
Example:
Input :
nums= { 1, 2, 4, 9, 5, 3, 8, 7, 10, 12, 14 }
Output:
Array with every second element is greater than its left and right elements:
[1, 4, 2, 9, 3, 8, 5, 10, 7, 14, 12]
